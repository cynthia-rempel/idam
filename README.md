# idam
Ideas for creating an idam appliance, of course, 
the right answer is probably the Univention Corporate Server or FreeIPA, 
but I want to have fun mixing and matching

## Directory + Kerberos Servers

Endless possibilities... Starting from the top

ApacheDS - I like this because I like Apache

Install options:
0. Install from RPM
1. Install from zip
2. Install from source (I'm curious how far I can get without building it though :)

389 Directory Server - it has a nice GUI

OpenLDAP - it's really popular

FreeIPA

## Tabled ideas

Ideas that are probably good, but I'm struck by something else...

Cloudera has a supported version of apache knox, and great documentation, but I think it needed dependencies that I didn't install
